# 🌌 MFSU Noise Generator - 1/f Spectral Noise Simulator

This project implements an advanced interactive 1/f^α noise generator with full control over spectral parameters, generation methods, and anti-artifact filters. It was created as part of the **Unified Fractal-Stochastic Model (MFSU)**, a scientific framework that seeks to explain:

- The power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
- Fractal structures in physical systems
- Natural noise patterns across time and frequency domains

## 🔧 Features

- Generation Methods: Spectral FFT, Timmer-Koenig, Mandelbrot-Van Ness, Kasdin-Walter
- Adjustable spectral exponent (α)
- Time series and power spectrum visualization (log-log)
- Anti-artifact filtering: low-pass, high-pass, adaptive smoothing
- Automatic estimation of:
  - Spectral slope (α)
  - Fractal dimension (∂)
  - Hurst exponent (H)
  - R² correlation of log-log fit

## 🌍 Applications

This simulator supports the computational validation of the MFSU model.  
Early results indicate the model can replicate fractal spectral signatures seen in real-world data, such as the CMB.
